      "During my time at Nackademin I learned the backbone of object-oriented programming in java. We went thro objects, methods, interfaces, threads and more. We also learned to work with javaFx witch the final exam was based around, we made a Quiz Battle clone, witch you could play on a local network with friends. We got the knowledge about relational databases, how to make queries and pull data from the database, with plain java, making the connection our self and creating the queries. We got some insight into design patterns as well, with we had use of in our backend course where we worked as a team to develop a Rest Api for a web shop, as well as the frontend for the shop. This was a really fun project, we mimic a real one here from start to deliver and got some understanding on how you work in the real world as an agile team. We did this with our parallel class of testers who was testing our code thro the hole project. All of this in just the first year and more to come now when I start the second year with my internship at CGI!",
